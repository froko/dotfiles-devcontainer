[GitHub repository](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/tree/master/lsp)

### Custom Plugins

There is a folder named `lua/plugins/custom` that is reserved for custom plugins
you may add to your NeoVim configuration. This folder is excluded from the Git
repository, so you can add your own plugins without affecting the shared
configuration.
